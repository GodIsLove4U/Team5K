Idea
1. Goal: Use democratic and republican donations data to assess whether major economic and social events in the United States impact donations to presidential campaigns. Some questions/pieces of data we will assess include:
  * How much money do people donate on average?
  * What is the scale (highest/lowest) that people donate?
  * How are donations impacted by an election year?
  * Does the job market affect donations? How so?
  * What changes in donation amounts did we observe during the housing market crash?
  * What changes in donation amounts did we observe during the Dotcom bubble?
  * What changes in donation amounts are we observing during COVID19?
  * How would/could this relate to the COVID crises and job loss?
  * How soon did states shut down compared to others?
* We will overlay crises data on donations data in battleground states to assess impact
* We will build predictive models from financial crises/housing market crash/Dotcom bubble data and impact on donations

Problem Statements
* Has COVID impacted how much voters are donating this year?
* How does donor behavior differ between COVID crisis vs other crises?
* Have other major recession events impacted how much/how frequently/whether people choose to donate to presidential campaigns?
